# GPS2SRT
This app records video and saves your speed and location. Speed is saved as subtitles in [SRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) format and is visible when you play back the video. The path traveled is saved to [GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) file and can be displayed by other software.
